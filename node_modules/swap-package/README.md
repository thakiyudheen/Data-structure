# Array Swap Function

A simple utility function to swap elements in an array.

## usage
First, import the swap function into your JavaScript file:


const swap = require('array-swap-function');

Then, use the swap function to swap elements in an array. Here's an example:

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
swap(array, 0, 4);
console.log(array); // Output: [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]

In this example, the swap function is called with three arguments:

1-The array in which elements are to be swapped (array).
2-The index of the first element to be swapped (0).
3-The index of the second element to be swapped (4).
After calling swap, the elements at index 0 and index 4 in the array have been swapped.



This example clearly explains how to use the `swap` function by providing a step-by-step guide and an example usage scenario.

## Installation

You can install the `array-swap-function` package via npm:

```bash
npm install array-swap-function
